Calculate the letter frequency of a file and compare it to the standard letter frequencies of the english alphabet

# Project 2: stocks.ipynb

1. Download from https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/IBM/history?p=IBM , IBM's stock values from 01/01/1962 up to date
2. Find the percentage daily variance of the stock: 100*(open_value - close_value)/open_value
   and add a new column in a new excel file 
3. Create a histogram where x = daily variance percentage, y = number of days with that variance percentage
   In the same plot add max and min values with their corresponding dates (Seaborn,Matplotlib)
4. Use a statistical model to fit the data and plot it in the same plot (Scipy)
5. Automate the above procedure
